            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Coroner is an ancient Officer of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon- wealth, and ordained to be a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall pre≈øerver of the Peace, and to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Records of the Pleas of the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Office of the upper Bench, and of his owne view, and of abjurations, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawries, appeales, &amp;c. And this definition of him is given by <hi>Britton</hi> an ancient writer, <hi>fol.</hi> 3. with the which agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the booke <hi>de <abbr>tit</abbr> 
                     <abbr> Coron</abbr> in Fitz. <abbr>Nat</abbr> Br. pag.</hi> 186. where he amplifieth his power more largely, <hi>viz.</hi> That he ≈øhould carry Records of his owne view, Abjurations, Outlawries, Appeales, accu≈øements of theeves done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and of all non ≈øuits in appeales, and of all other things done in the County, that appertaine to the coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners office: and al≈øo in the court of freemen, which have franchi≈øes of infangtheef, &amp;c. And in the pre≈øence of the Coroner ≈øhall all appeales of Robberie and Larceny bee framed. The ≈øe things doe declare the office of a Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60734:4"/>to be an Office of tru≈øt, and of great authority: and for that cau≈øe it is requi≈øite that it be committed to a wi≈øe man, and of good behaviour, as it was well perceived by our ancient Fathers and predece≈ø≈øors, and chiefely by tho≈øe that made the Statute at We≈øtmin≈øter the 1. chp. 10. which rehear ≈øeth, for that that people of ≈ømall conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not of the wi≈øe≈øt, be now lately cho ≈øen to the office of Coroners, and much meeter it were, that wi≈øe men, loyall, and ≈øage, ≈øhould intermeddle with that office, It is provided, that through all Counties be cho≈øen ≈ø uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent men to be Coroners, of the mo≈øt loyall and mo≈øt ≈ø a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge≈øt Knights, which be≈øt know, can or will attend to that office, and that they lawfully keepe and pre≈øent the pleas of the Capitall office of the upper Bench: And that the Sherifes have counter-rolles of the Coroners, as well of Appeales as of Inque≈øts concerning Attachments or other matters appertaining to that office. And that no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roner ≈øhal demand any thing, or take any thing to execute his office, upon paine of a great forfeiture to the Keepers of the liberty of England by authority of Parliament to the u ≈øe of the common-wealth.</p>
               <p>The Statute committeth this Office to Knights, and not to any others, and therefore it was held to be a maine cau≈øe to remove and di≈øcharge a coroner from his office, if he be not a Knight: but Ma≈øter <hi>Fitzherbet</hi> in his <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura brevium</hi> in his writ <hi>de Coronator. <abbr>eligend</abbr>
                  </hi> would not allow the ≈ø ame for a ≈øufficient cau≈øe at this day, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; That tho≈øe words were put into the Statute, to the intent that a Coroner ≈øhould have ≈øufficient within the county to an≈øwer for all that he doth or ought to doe by his ≈øaid office.</p>
               <p>Al≈øo this Statute requireth ≈øuch a Coroner as can, will, &amp; may attend to execute the ≈øaid office. And therfore if ≈øuch a Coroner be elected &amp; ch≈øen as cannot, will not, nor may not attend the execution of the ≈øame office, he is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved &amp; di≈ø charged by Writ from the ≈øame office: &amp; the cau≈øe of his not attendance or in≈ø ufficiency mu≈øt bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hear≈øed in the writ, <hi>viz.</hi> that he is occupied in other of the<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60734:4"/>common-wealths affaires, or that he is not in health, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, or unapt for the ≈øame Office, or that he is in≈øufficient in lands, or that he hath the pal≈øie, or that his abode is in the uttermo≈øt parts of the county, or that he is nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Sherife, or Ranger of a Forre≈øt: but if any of the≈øe cau≈øes be untrue, and the Coroner thereby di≈øcharged of his office by a fal≈øe ≈øugge≈øtion, Then hee may if he will goe to the Chancery, and there by petition pray a Commi≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to inquire of this fal≈øe ≈øugge≈øtion, the which if it bee found, and returned to the Chancery, then the Keepers of the Libertie of England by the authority of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament may grant a <hi>Super≈øedeas</hi> to the Sherife of that County, that hee remove not the ≈øaid Coroner from his office, and if hee bee removed before the <hi>Super≈øedeas</hi> come, then that he permit the Coroner removed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute his office as he did before his removall, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in Ma≈øter <hi>Fitzh. Nat. Bre.</hi> in and by the writs <hi>de Coron. elegendo, &amp; de Electione viridariorum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it ≈øhall be farre more commendable for him that is cho≈øen a Coroner, that if he perceive any of the ≈øaid im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments to bee in him≈øelfe, that he then doe purcha≈øe a Writ to di≈øcharge him≈øelfe from the ≈ø aid office, which Writ he ≈øhall finde in the Regi≈øter, fol. 177.</p>
               <p>This Statute al≈øo willeth that no Coroner ≈øhall take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing for doing of his office, &amp;c. for this purpo≈øe, that he wholly may be at liberty to doe and execute Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtice and Right, and therefore within twelve yeares after there was a Statute made to puni≈øh that corruption and extortion, which is called <hi>Statutum Exoniae,</hi> made the fourteenth year of <hi>E.</hi> 1. which you ≈øhall finde in the book called <hi>≈ø ecunda pars veterum Statutorum,</hi> by the which al≈øo it appeareth that a Coroner ought to take nothing for executing of his office, which I finde not altered by any Statute untill 3 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. which giveth him in mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der 13.<abbr>≈ø.</abbr> 4. <abbr>d.</abbr> of the goods of the murderer, if he have any goods, but if he have none, then the Coroner is to have his Fee by amercing of the village for ≈øuffering the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer to e≈øcape, and if any particular per≈øon ≈øhall bee<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60734:5"/>found guilty of ≈ø uch e≈øcape, the Coroner hath power to enquire thereof by the ≈øame Statute.</p>
               <p>But I finde, <hi>
                     <abbr>tit</abbr> Cor. in Fitz. fol.</hi> 321. &amp; 371. that a Coroner hath a Fee belonging to his office, <hi>viz.</hi> of every Vi≈øne one penny, when they appeare before the Ju≈øtices of Eyre.</p>
               <p>But that Fee is not repugnant to the Statute of <hi>We≈øt.</hi> 1. for he receiveth not the ≈øame to doe his office, but as a right due to him though that he executeth no part of his office, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Al≈øo the Statute of 1 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. prohibiteth a Coroner to take any thing for doing of his office, upon paine of 40. <abbr>≈ø.</abbr> for every default.</p>
               <p>And al≈øo upon like penalty, where he giveth not his attendance when he is ≈øent for and required to make Inqui≈øition upon the death of any dead corps, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And ≈øince the Stat. of We≈øtmin≈øter the fir≈øt, it was ordained and enacted by a Statute made <hi>
                     <abbr>An</abbr>
                  </hi> 14. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. cap. 7. that no Coroner bee cho≈øen if hee have not lands ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in the ≈øame County wherewith he may an≈øwer all manner of people. This Statute is in the negative, and therefore the not ≈ø atisfying of the ≈øame Statute, is good cau≈øe to remove him from his office, by the Writ before remembred, the which Writ declareth how he ≈øhall be ≈øaid, to bee ≈øufficient, and in what ≈øort the ≈øame ≈øhall be examined, <hi>viz.</hi> if hee have lands in the county upon the which he may dwell agreeable to his degree, for the exerci≈øing of the ≈øame Office.</p>
               <p>Al≈øo after by another Statute made <hi>anno</hi> 28 <hi>Ed.</hi>3. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. it was enacted, That all Coroners of every County ≈øhould be cho≈øen in the open Counties by the Freeholders of the ≈øaid county, of the mo≈øt conveniente≈øt and mo≈øt loyal≈øt people that may bee found in the ≈øaid Counties, to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the ≈øaid Office: alwaies ≈øaving to the Keepers of the Liberty of England by authority of the Parliament, to the u≈øe of the Commonwealth, and other Lords their Seigniories and Franchi≈øes.</p>

And Homicide of nece≈ø≈øity is when a man cannot chu≈øe but he mu≈øt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kill or be killed, and that will be taken to be in his owne defence: then there is Homicide inevitable for the advancement of Ju≈ø tice; And that is where a Sherife or other officer by warrant pur≈øues a Felon which will not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey or yeeld him≈øelf, but offereth violence, and ≈øo is kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in apprehending, or where a man killeth a theefe which would rob him: In the≈øe ca≈øes he which commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth ≈øuch Homicide ≈øhall be acquitted, and neither lo≈øe life, lands, or goods for the ≈øame. There are other Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides which are no Felony, and that is where a mad man either kills him≈ø elfe or any other per≈øon when he is mad, or where a child is killed in the mothers belly not <hi>in rerum natura,</hi> and that for two cau≈øes, <hi> viz.</hi> one becau≈øe it had not the name of Bapti≈øme, and the other becau≈øe it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be certainely known whether the mother killed it by ≈øome other meanes or no; but if an Infant of nine years old kill a man, woman, or child, if ≈øuch Infant then knew good from evill, it is felony in ≈øuch an Infant, and that will be well knowne and perceived by the an≈øwer of ≈øuch an Infant to ≈øuch que ≈øtions as may be demanded of him: or here al≈øo if a man take upon him to be a Phy≈ø itian or a Surgeon, and not allowed to u≈øe and practi≈øe ≈øuch fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, if he take upon him a cure which dyeth under his hands by his ignorance, it is held to be Felonie in ≈øuch Phy≈ø itian or Surgeon. Al≈øo if a man keep a dangerous bea≈øt, as a Bull, a Beare, a Dog, or ≈øuch like, he knowing<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60734:7"/>them to be dangerous, and yet doth not keep them tied, but wilfully ≈øuffereth ≈øuch bea≈øts to goe at large without a keeper, if ≈øuch bea≈ø t kill a man, woman, or child, it is held to bee Felony in the owner of ≈øuch Bea≈øt: Al≈øo there is another kinde of Homicide, which is a kinde of Murder called <hi>Felo de ≈øe,</hi>and that is where one hangs, or kills, or drownes him≈øelfe for lack of grace: for as it is Murder and Felony for one man willingly and wilfully to kill another; ≈øo likewi≈øe it is murder and felony for a man to kill or drowne him ≈øelfe willingly &amp; wilfully, yet they are not both in one ca≈øe and predicament; for the fir≈øt doth forfeite by that fact both his lands, and his goods, and the other forfeites but goods and chattels, and no lands. There is al≈øo another kinde of Homicide, not done by man, but by ca≈øuall means, and that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Homicide by mi≈øadventure or misfortune, by a Hor≈øe, or a Cart, or a Bough of a tree, or ≈øuch like: and in this ca≈øe, <hi>omne quod movet cum eo quod occidit hominem <abbr>deo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dand</abbr> e≈øt Reipublicae;</hi> every thing that moveth with that which kills a man is Deodan, unle≈ø≈øe the Keepers of the Liberty of England by authority of Parliament have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly granted the ≈øame away to ≈øome Lord of a Liberty, as is commonly done, then if it happen to be within ≈øuch liberty, it belongs to the Lord of the Liberty. But if any of the≈øe Homicides fall out to be wilfull Murder, which is a mo ≈ø t bloody and a crying ≈øinne, and cannot be too ≈øeverely puni≈øhed, and therefore by the Law, the offender herein ought to lo≈øe both life, lands, and goods, an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. And if Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈ølaughter, if the offender can read well, then he may in favour of life, by the Keepers of the Liberty of England afore≈øaid mercy, have the benefit of his Clergy, and ≈øo ≈øave his life, but he ≈øhall lo≈øe and forfeite both his lands and goods, and yet the Law of God not therein ≈øatisfied: The goods mu ≈øt be found, apprai≈øed, and valued, of ≈øuch offendors, and left in the Town≈øhip or Village where ≈ø uch offendor dwelleth, by them ≈øafely to be kept, until the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendor be acquitted or convicted by due cour≈øe of Law; in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60734:8"/>the meane time the offender mu≈øt be maintained with his goods, ≈øo as he may be kept alive to an≈øwer his fact, and what ≈øhall remaine when he is convicted, tho≈øe to whom ≈øuch goods doe belong by the Law mu≈øt have them, and not before, and thereof di ≈øcharge the Town≈øhip or Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage which had the cu≈øtody of ≈øuch goods. And as for the offendors Free land, if he have any, immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conviction, the Keepers of the Liberty of England by authority of Parliament to the u≈øe of the Commonwealth mu ≈øt have <hi>annum, diem, &amp; va≈øtum</hi> therein, and after the Lord of whom it is holden ≈øhall have it as an E≈øcheat. And thus having di≈ø cour≈øed at large of all the≈øe things incident to my office for your in≈øtruction, I will make an end and trouble you no more at this time: and ≈øo you ≈ø hall heare your evidence.</p>

For now, be it that the principall appeare, or make default, the Acce≈ø≈øory, if he appeare, ≈øhall an≈øwer, but if hee plead to an i≈ø≈øue, proce≈øse ≈øhall cea≈øe to bee awarded again≈øt him for his tryall, untill the principall doe appeare, or or be attainted of Outlawry, <hi>ut pat. &amp;</hi> 9. <hi>H.</hi> 4. &amp; 7. <hi>H.</hi> 4. but yet tho≈øe Proce≈øs again≈øt the Jury ≈øhall not cea≈øe, unle≈øs the Acce≈ø≈øory will, for if the Acce≈øsory will pray Proce ≈øs again≈øt the Inque≈øt, before the principall be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted, hee ≈øhall have them, in that it is domage to none but him≈øelfe. And whether he be attainted or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted, it is good, and he ≈øhall not be againe arraigned for that offence; for the taking of the Inque≈øt or ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict is not erroneous for the rea≈øon before made, <hi>ut patet titulo Coron.</hi> 463. The ≈øame Law is if the Acce≈øsory will wage his battell with the appellant before the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall doth come, <hi>ut patet ibidem pag.</hi> 8. for he may waive the benefit that the Law doth give him therein, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Note ye that if the plea which the Acce≈ø≈øory doth pleade, be a plea in abatement of the whole writ, the principall therein ≈øhall have the advantage, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈ø tanding his ab≈øence, ≈øo that the Exigent that is to bee awarded again≈øt the principall ≈øhall ≈øtay till it be known whether the whole writ ≈øhall abate or not, <hi>ut patet</hi> 9 <hi>H.</hi> 4. but if they both doe appeare, <hi>viz.</hi> the principal and the acce≈øsory, then the principall mu≈øt fir≈øt an≈øwer, and after the acce≈øsory, for ≈øuch an≈øwer the principall may make, that the acce≈øsory ≈øhall not bee put to an≈øwer till the an≈øwer of the principall bee tried. And that is where the principall doth not pleade directly to the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, but ≈øome other plea; As if he plead that he was once before attainted of the ≈øame Felony, and the appellant to the contrary that is not ≈øo, and ≈øo they are at i≈øsue, in this ca≈øe the Acce≈øsory ≈øhall not an≈øwer before that i≈ø sue be tryed, 9 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>Quaere</hi> if the like Law bee where the principall pleadeth in abatement of the whole writ,<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60734:23"/>&amp;c. But if the Principall pleade to the Felony, the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øory then pre≈øently after ≈øuch plea ≈ø hall pleade al≈øo: And if they be at i≈ø≈øue, a <hi> venire <abbr>fac</abbr>
                  </hi> may bee awarded again≈øt them all, <hi>ut patet tit.

And that agreeth with that which was ≈øayd before, <hi>≈ø cilicet,</hi> that the Inque≈øt ≈øhall ≈øtay for the Acce≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary till ≈øuch time as the principall commeth to bee at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted by outlawry, &amp;c. Note, when I ≈ø peake of the principall, I meane then all the principals; for if there be divers ≈øued as principalls, and ≈ø ome of them doe come, and ≈øome doe not, yet the Inque≈øt ≈øhall ≈øtay untill all the principals doe come, or bee attainted of Outlawry, if it bee ≈øo that hee bee appealed or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted as acce≈ø≈ø ory unto them all: otherwi≈øe it is if hee not appealed or indicted as acce≈ø≈øory to one of them; for there it ≈øufficieth tho≈øe principals onely to come, or to bee attainted for whom hee is appealed or indicted as acce≈ø≈øory, without having regard to the re≈øidue, <hi>quod vid.</hi> 7. <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>fol.</hi> 30. <hi>&amp; tit.

Al≈øo note yee, that it is requi≈øite that this attainder of the principall be in the ≈øame ≈øuite in which the acce≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaryes be ≈øued, for if it bee in another ≈øuite, that will not permit the Acce≈øsorie to proceed in his Inque≈øt till ≈ø uch time as the principall that is ≈øued with him doe come in, or be attainted by Proce≈øs as afore≈øayd. And in an appeale of death, again≈øt the principall and the acce≈ø≈øory, the principall before that time is attainted of the very ≈øame death, upon an Indictment at the Keepers of the Liberty of England by authority of Parliament ≈øuite, <hi>ut patet</hi> 7.<hi>H.</hi>4. <hi>fol.</hi> 30. <hi>Quaere,</hi> if the acce≈ø≈ø ory ≈øhall pleade for his di≈øcharge the acquittall of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall in another ≈øuite, <hi>ut patet</hi> 277. Al≈øo it ≈øeemeth, that if the principall ≈øince that attainder is dead, and the Ju≈øtices before whom ≈øuch Acce≈ø≈øory is ≈øued, have before them the record of the attainder, that then they<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60734:23"/>may proceed again≈øt the Acce≈øsory, otherwi≈øe not, 7. <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>fol.</hi> 23.

That, that notwith≈øtanding, the Acce≈øsory ≈ø hall be arraigned, <hi>quod vide titulo Corone</hi> 36. <hi>&amp;</hi> 51. where the principall challengeth above the number of 36. which was peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to him, therefore hee was hanged without farther triall, becau≈øe he ≈øhould challenge but ju≈ø t 36. or under, and not above, and in that ca≈øe the acce≈ø≈øory was tried and found guilty; and the ju≈øtices did advi≈øe with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, what ≈øhould be done in that ca≈øe, for they were of divers opinions, &amp;c. This attainder whereof wee have ≈øo often ≈øpoken, though that it be erronious, yet not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding that court ≈øhall proceede with the acce ≈ø≈øory, for the acce≈ø≈øory ≈øhall utterly take advantage of that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, <hi>quod vide anno</hi> 2 <hi>R.</hi> 3. <hi>f.</hi> 21. Al≈ø o there is one ca≈øe, that although the principal be not attainted, yet the Acce≈ø≈øory ≈ø hal be hanged, As if one Abjure as Acce≈ø≈øorie, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Principall cometh, not being attainted, <hi>Tamen</hi>-the Ju≈øtices <hi>in favore vitae,</hi> did inquire if the Acce≈ø≈øorie was attainted or not. The ≈øame law ≈øhall be in the ca≈øes above≈øaid, as it ≈øeemeth where the Acce≈ø≈øory of his own good will will wage battaile, or have the inque≈øt proceed before the Principall doth come, &amp;c.</p>

And for that you ≈øhall the better con≈øider and inquire of, and pre≈øent all things which are now here pre≈øentable, I have mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtred unto you a corporal oath, which oath ≈øtandeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on three parts (that is to ≈øay) upon Truth, Judgement, and Ju≈øtice: It ≈ø tandeth upon truth, for that you ought to pre≈øent nothing but the Truth, and likewi≈øe not to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any thing that is true and pre≈øentable here unpre ≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; It ≈ø tandeth upon Judgement, that you do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent any thing ra≈øhly or unadvi≈øedly, but certainly to know the truth thereof before you do pre≈øent it; And it ≈ø tandeth upon Ju≈øtice, that you do not for favor, affection, corruption of money, or other reward, for fear of any mans di≈ø plea≈øure, or for any private gaine or profit, leave any thing unpre≈øented that is here pre≈ø entable, neither for malice to pre≈øent any thing contrary to the truth.
