            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Coroner is an ancient Officer of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon- wealth, and ordained to be a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall preſerver of the Peace, and to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Records of the Pleas of the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Office of the upper Bench, and of his owne view, and of abjurations, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawries, appeales, &amp;c. And this definition of him is given by <hi>Britton</hi> an ancient writer, <hi>fol.</hi> 3. with the which agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the booke <hi>de <abbr>tit</abbr> 
                     <abbr> Coron</abbr> in Fitz. <abbr>Nat</abbr> Br. pag.</hi> 186. where he amplifieth his power more largely, <hi>viz.</hi> That he ſhould carry Records of his owne view, Abjurations, Outlawries, Appeales, accuſements of theeves done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and of all non ſuits in appeales, and of all other things done in the County, that appertaine to the coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners office: and alſo in the court of freemen, which have franchiſes of infangtheef, &amp;c. And in the preſence of the Coroner ſhall all appeales of Robberie and Larceny bee framed. The ſe things doe declare the office of a Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60734:4"/>to be an Office of truſt, and of great authority: and for that cauſe it is requiſite that it be committed to a wiſe man, and of good behaviour, as it was well perceived by our ancient Fathers and predeceſſors, and chiefely by thoſe that made the Statute at Weſtminſter the 1. chp. 10. which rehear ſeth, for that that people of ſmall conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not of the wiſeſt, be now lately cho ſen to the office of Coroners, and much meeter it were, that wiſe men, loyall, and ſage, ſhould intermeddle with that office, It is provided, that through all Counties be choſen ſ uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent men to be Coroners, of the moſt loyall and moſt ſ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt Knights, which beſt know, can or will attend to that office, and that they lawfully keepe and preſent the pleas of the Capitall office of the upper Bench: And that the Sherifes have counter-rolles of the Coroners, as well of Appeales as of Inqueſts concerning Attachments or other matters appertaining to that office. And that no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roner ſhal demand any thing, or take any thing to execute his office, upon paine of a great forfeiture to the Keepers of the liberty of England by authority of Parliament to the u ſe of the common-wealth.</p>
               <p>The Statute committeth this Office to Knights, and not to any others, and therefore it was held to be a maine cauſe to remove and diſcharge a coroner from his office, if he be not a Knight: but Maſter <hi>Fitzherbet</hi> in his <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura brevium</hi> in his writ <hi>de Coronator. <abbr>eligend</abbr>
                  </hi> would not allow the ſ ame for a ſufficient cauſe at this day, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; That thoſe words were put into the Statute, to the intent that a Coroner ſhould have ſufficient within the county to anſwer for all that he doth or ought to doe by his ſaid office.</p>
               <p>Alſo this Statute requireth ſuch a Coroner as can, will, &amp; may attend to execute the ſaid office. And therfore if ſuch a Coroner be elected &amp; chſen as cannot, will not, nor may not attend the execution of the ſame office, he is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved &amp; diſ charged by Writ from the ſame office: &amp; the cauſe of his not attendance or inſ ufficiency muſt bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed in the writ, <hi>viz.</hi> that he is occupied in other of the<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60734:4"/>common-wealths affaires, or that he is not in health, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, or unapt for the ſame Office, or that he is inſufficient in lands, or that he hath the palſie, or that his abode is in the uttermoſt parts of the county, or that he is nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Sherife, or Ranger of a Forreſt: but if any of theſe cauſes be untrue, and the Coroner thereby diſcharged of his office by a falſe ſuggeſtion, Then hee may if he will goe to the Chancery, and there by petition pray a Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to inquire of this falſe ſuggeſtion, the which if it bee found, and returned to the Chancery, then the Keepers of the Libertie of England by the authority of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament may grant a <hi>Superſedeas</hi> to the Sherife of that County, that hee remove not the ſaid Coroner from his office, and if hee bee removed before the <hi>Superſedeas</hi> come, then that he permit the Coroner removed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute his office as he did before his removall, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in Maſter <hi>Fitzh. Nat. Bre.</hi> in and by the writs <hi>de Coron. elegendo, &amp; de Electione viridariorum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it ſhall be farre more commendable for him that is choſen a Coroner, that if he perceive any of the ſaid im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments to bee in himſelfe, that he then doe purchaſe a Writ to diſcharge himſelfe from the ſ aid office, which Writ he ſhall finde in the Regiſter, fol. 177.</p>
               <p>This Statute alſo willeth that no Coroner ſhall take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing for doing of his office, &amp;c. for this purpoſe, that he wholly may be at liberty to doe and execute Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Right, and therefore within twelve yeares after there was a Statute made to puniſh that corruption and extortion, which is called <hi>Statutum Exoniae,</hi> made the fourteenth year of <hi>E.</hi> 1. which you ſhall finde in the book called <hi>ſ ecunda pars veterum Statutorum,</hi> by the which alſo it appeareth that a Coroner ought to take nothing for executing of his office, which I finde not altered by any Statute untill 3 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. which giveth him in mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der 13.<abbr>ſ.</abbr> 4. <abbr>d.</abbr> of the goods of the murderer, if he have any goods, but if he have none, then the Coroner is to have his Fee by amercing of the village for ſuffering the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer to eſcape, and if any particular perſon ſhall bee<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60734:5"/>found guilty of ſ uch eſcape, the Coroner hath power to enquire thereof by the ſame Statute.</p>
               <p>But I finde, <hi>
                     <abbr>tit</abbr> Cor. in Fitz. fol.</hi> 321. &amp; 371. that a Coroner hath a Fee belonging to his office, <hi>viz.</hi> of every Viſne one penny, when they appeare before the Juſtices of Eyre.</p>
               <p>But that Fee is not repugnant to the Statute of <hi>Weſt.</hi> 1. for he receiveth not the ſame to doe his office, but as a right due to him though that he executeth no part of his office, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Alſo the Statute of 1 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. prohibiteth a Coroner to take any thing for doing of his office, upon paine of 40. <abbr>ſ.</abbr> for every default.</p>
               <p>And alſo upon like penalty, where he giveth not his attendance when he is ſent for and required to make Inquiſition upon the death of any dead corps, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And ſince the Stat. of Weſtminſter the firſt, it was ordained and enacted by a Statute made <hi>
                     <abbr>An</abbr>
                  </hi> 14. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. cap. 7. that no Coroner bee choſen if hee have not lands ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in the ſame County wherewith he may anſwer all manner of people. This Statute is in the negative, and therefore the not ſ atisfying of the ſame Statute, is good cauſe to remove him from his office, by the Writ before remembred, the which Writ declareth how he ſhall be ſaid, to bee ſufficient, and in what ſort the ſame ſhall be examined, <hi>viz.</hi> if hee have lands in the county upon the which he may dwell agreeable to his degree, for the exerciſing of the ſame Office.</p>
               <p>Alſo after by another Statute made <hi>anno</hi> 28 <hi>Ed.</hi>3. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. it was enacted, That all Coroners of every County ſhould be choſen in the open Counties by the Freeholders of the ſaid county, of the moſt convenienteſt and moſt loyalſt people that may bee found in the ſaid Counties, to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the ſaid Office: alwaies ſaving to the Keepers of the Liberty of England by authority of the Parliament, to the uſe of the Commonwealth, and other Lords their Seigniories and Franchiſes.</p>
               <p>And note, that when a Coroner is choſen, he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine Officer ſo long as he behave himſelfe well therein<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60734:5"/> and is not changeable every year, as the Sherifes and Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheators are, <hi>qd vid. <abbr>Hil</abbr>
                  </hi> 4 E. <hi>fol.</hi> 44.</p>
               <p>Alſo when he is elected, the Sherife of the ſame Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or his Underſherife, muſ t give him his oath thus as followeth.</p>

                           <p>SIrs, you that be ſworne, you ſhall underſtand what the cauſe of our meeting is here now at this preſent, It is to inquire and preſent or find, how <hi>A.B.</hi> came to his death: for when any man, woman, or child doe come to to their death by any caſualty, or untimely meanes, then the Keepers of the Liberty of England by authority of Parliament have appointed Coroners in every County to inquire thereof by the oathes of men: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by vertue of mine Office, I have cauſed you to bee called hither, and have impannelled and ſworne you to that purpoſ e, to the end that the Keepers of the Liberty of England aforeſaid, and their immediate Officers may be truely certified how and by what meanes a member of this Common-wealth is lo ſt: Therefore now your charge is, to inquire how and by what meanes the ſaid <hi>A.B.</hi> came to his death, that a true record may be made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; If he was ſlaine in fight, then you muſt inquire by whom, when, and where, &amp; in what manner, and with what weapon, as neere as you can, &amp; what goods, chattells, lands or hereditaments the offender had at the time of the fact committed, or at any time ſithence, and whether hee bee fled for the ſame or no; For I muſt tell you, that Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners have authority to enquire by their Office of all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of homicids and ſ laughters of men, eſpecially above all other things, and that by the oathes of men <hi>ſ uper vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum Corporis,</hi> and not otherwiſe: And theſe homicides and ſlaughters of men are of divers kinds or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, but they are all comprehended within two kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> ſpirituall homicide, and corporall homicide: the firſt is the ſlaughter and deſ truction of the ſoule, which is Gods part, if he dye in the faith of Chriſt: and the other is the ſlaughter of the body, which is the Commonwealths part, that muſt take his end by the due execution of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice for the offence committed againſt the Law: and a corporall homicide is twofold, that is to ſay, <hi>Lingua, &amp; facto,</hi> Tongue and Fact; <hi>Lingua,</hi> by the Tongue is three<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60734:7"/>fold, <hi>viz.</hi> in commanding, in giving of counſell, and in deſending: <hi>Facto,</hi> by Fact, is foure fold, <hi>viz.</hi> in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Juſtice, Homicide willingly done, Homicide done by chance, and Homicide done by neceſſity: Homicide done by Juſtice, is when a man is juſtly condemned and executed for his offence: Homicide willingly done, is either murther, or at the leaſt manſ laughter: Homicide done by chance, is by ſome accidentall means, as where one is killed by caſting of a ſtone unawares, or ſhooting of an arrow, or ſuch like, and killeth one againſt the will or intent of him that caſteth or ſhooteth. And Homicide of neceſſity is when a man cannot chuſe but he muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kill or be killed, and that will be taken to be in his owne defence: then there is Homicide inevitable for the advancement of Juſ tice; And that is where a Sherife or other officer by warrant purſues a Felon which will not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey or yeeld himſelf, but offereth violence, and ſo is kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in apprehending, or where a man killeth a theefe which would rob him: In theſe caſes he which commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth ſuch Homicide ſhall be acquitted, and neither loſe life, lands, or goods for the ſame. There are other Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides which are no Felony, and that is where a mad man either kills himſ elfe or any other perſon when he is mad, or where a child is killed in the mothers belly not <hi>in rerum natura,</hi> and that for two cauſes, <hi> viz.</hi> one becauſe it had not the name of Baptiſme, and the other becauſe it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be certainely known whether the mother killed it by ſome other meanes or no; but if an Infant of nine years old kill a man, woman, or child, if ſuch Infant then knew good from evill, it is felony in ſuch an Infant, and that will be well knowne and perceived by the anſwer of ſuch an Infant to ſuch que ſtions as may be demanded of him: or here alſo if a man take upon him to be a Phyſ itian or a Surgeon, and not allowed to uſe and practiſe ſuch fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, if he take upon him a cure which dyeth under his hands by his ignorance, it is held to be Felonie in ſuch Phyſ itian or Surgeon. Alſo if a man keep a dangerous beaſt, as a Bull, a Beare, a Dog, or ſuch like, he knowing<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60734:7"/>them to be dangerous, and yet doth not keep them tied, but wilfully ſuffereth ſuch beaſts to goe at large without a keeper, if ſuch beaſ t kill a man, woman, or child, it is held to bee Felony in the owner of ſuch Beaſt: Alſo there is another kinde of Homicide, which is a kinde of Murder called <hi>Felo de ſe,</hi>and that is where one hangs, or kills, or drownes himſelfe for lack of grace: for as it is Murder and Felony for one man willingly and wilfully to kill another; ſo likewiſe it is murder and felony for a man to kill or drowne him ſelfe willingly &amp; wilfully, yet they are not both in one caſe and predicament; for the firſt doth forfeite by that fact both his lands, and his goods, and the other forfeites but goods and chattels, and no lands. There is alſo another kinde of Homicide, not done by man, but by caſuall means, and that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Homicide by miſadventure or misfortune, by a Horſe, or a Cart, or a Bough of a tree, or ſuch like: and in this caſe, <hi>omne quod movet cum eo quod occidit hominem <abbr>deo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dand</abbr> eſt Reipublicae;</hi> every thing that moveth with that which kills a man is Deodan, unleſſe the Keepers of the Liberty of England by authority of Parliament have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly granted the ſame away to ſome Lord of a Liberty, as is commonly done, then if it happen to be within ſuch liberty, it belongs to the Lord of the Liberty. But if any of theſe Homicides fall out to be wilfull Murder, which is a mo ſ t bloody and a crying ſinne, and cannot be too ſeverely puniſhed, and therefore by the Law, the offender herein ought to loſe both life, lands, and goods, an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. And if Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughter, if the offender can read well, then he may in favour of life, by the Keepers of the Liberty of England aforeſaid mercy, have the benefit of his Clergy, and ſo ſave his life, but he ſhall loſe and forfeite both his lands and goods, and yet the Law of God not therein ſatisfied: The goods mu ſt be found, appraiſed, and valued, of ſuch offendors, and left in the Townſhip or Village where ſ uch offendor dwelleth, by them ſafely to be kept, until the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendor be acquitted or convicted by due courſe of Law; in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60734:8"/>the meane time the offender muſt be maintained with his goods, ſo as he may be kept alive to anſwer his fact, and what ſhall remaine when he is convicted, thoſe to whom ſuch goods doe belong by the Law muſt have them, and not before, and thereof di ſcharge the Townſhip or Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage which had the cuſtody of ſuch goods. And as for the offendors Free land, if he have any, immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conviction, the Keepers of the Liberty of England by authority of Parliament to the uſe of the Commonwealth mu ſt have <hi>annum, diem, &amp; vaſtum</hi> therein, and after the Lord of whom it is holden ſhall have it as an Eſcheat. And thus having diſ courſed at large of all theſe things incident to my office for your inſtruction, I will make an end and trouble you no more at this time: and ſo you ſ hall heare your evidence.</p>

               <head>Of wilfull Murther.</head>
               <p>This office is the higheſt and greateſt offence that a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roner is to meddle withall by his office, and it is defined by <hi>Bracton</hi> to bee ſecret killing of ſtrangers and men knowne, none knowing or ſeeing it beſides the murtherer and his aiders, ſo that no Hue-and-cry of the County preſently follow, &amp;c. And ſo you may ſ ee how that <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glechery,</hi> that is, that he is Engliſh, &amp;c. was preſented in ancient time untill the fourteenth yeare of <hi>E.</hi> 3. At which titme by a Statute made the 14. <hi>Edward</hi> 3. cap. 4. the preſentment of <hi>Englechery</hi> was wholly abrogated and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled, the letter of which Statute is thus, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Item,</hi> for that there are many miſchiefs happened in many countries in England, which knew not how to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Englechery,</hi> for which cau ſe the Commons of the Counties oftentimes were before the Juſtices in Eyre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merced, to the great grievance of the people; It is therefore agreed that at no time hereafter any Juſtice of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60734:9"/>any Eyre ſhall put any article or oppoſition preſenting <hi>Englechery</hi> to the Commons of the Counties, nor againſt any of them. But that for ever <hi>Englechery</hi> and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/> ſ entment thereof to be wholly omitted and made void; ſo that none for this cauſe be from henceforth impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: By the words of this Statute it appeareth, that the preſentment of <hi>Englechery</hi> was ſo divers by the divers cuſ tomes of ſeverall countries, that the countries knew not well how to ſatisfie the Juſtices in the preſenting thereof, but for the undue preſenting thereof, they were often amerced and ſore grieved: And yet <hi>Bracton</hi> ſ aith, Becauſe in divers Countries <hi>Englechery</hi> is differently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ ented in every Eire, the cuſtome of preſenting it is to be inquired from the beginning. Alſ o hee putteth there in his Booke many things which excuſ eth the Country by the Common Law from that amerciament or payment of lxvj. markes, for he ſaith in this manner, <hi>That is weighed ſometime, &amp;c.</hi> And that alſo was the common Law appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in <hi>Britton fol.</hi> 15. which agreeth throughout with that which <hi>Bracton</hi> hath here written, the which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law is changed as I have ſaid before by the ſaid Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute made in the 14. yeare of <hi>E.</hi> 3. wherefore a man at this day may define murther in other manner than <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cton</hi> and <hi>Britton</hi>did, viz. It is murther when any man of malice prepenced killeth another felloniouſ ly, having no regard whether he kill him openly or ſecretly, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be an Engliſhman or not, ſo that hee live in the Weale publique under the Parliaments protection, and Homicide that is done in ſuch manner is called Murder at this day; for the name of Murder was not at any time changed, but the Law retained the ſame continually, for the hainouſnes of the crime, to put a difference between homicide Chance-medley and Murder: And therefore if a man be indicted of Murder, at this day, a pardon of all Felonies will not helpe him, and that is by the Statute of 13 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. the letter whereof you may ſee hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: And alſo the Statute of 1 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ ueth, <hi>videlicet.</hi> Provided alſo, and be it enacted by the<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60734:9"/>authority aforeſaid, that all wilfull killing by poyſoning of any perſon or perſons that at any time hereafter ſhall be done, perpetrated or committed, ſhall be adjudged, taken, and deemed wilfull Murder of malice prepenced, and that the offendors therein, their ayders, abettors, procurers, and counſellers ſhall ſ uffer death, and forfeite in every behalf, as in other caſes of wilfull murder of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice prepenced.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughter.</note>Manſlaughter is where one killeth another having no malice prepenced ſo to doe, yet it is felony, and he ſ hall loſe his lands and goods, and his life too, if he cannot read well, as is ſaid before in the charge: The which thing if a mad man doe, it is no felony in him, nor he ſhall not be arraigned for it, when he is of good memory, as it appeareth in <hi>Fitzh. fol.</hi> 33. and 21 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. <hi>tamen</hi> in the Eyres of <hi>Northampton</hi> in 3 <hi>E.</hi> 3.

               <p>And if a Surgeon or a Phyſ itian allowed, have one in cure, which dyeth preſently after, or within a ſhort time after, that is no Felony, for that he did nothing feloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly: but if he killed him with Phyſick or Surgery, it was done againſt his will, <hi>quod vide titulo Coronae</hi> 163. <hi>et Britton fol.</hi> 14. <hi>c.

                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:60734:10"/>Alſo if a man have a Bull, a Beare, or a Dog, which is accuſ tomed to doe hurt, and his maſter or owner well knowing the ſ ame, yet doe not tie him but ſuffer him to goe at large, and being ſo at large, he killeth a man, this is held by <hi>Fitzherbert,</hi> 311. to bee Felony in the owner of the beaſt, by reaſon of the ſufferance, for thereby the owner ſeemeth to have a will to kill: And note that in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient time, the will was ſo materiall, that the ſame was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the fact, <hi>ut patet titulo</hi> 1. E. 3. where one compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the death of another, woundeth him ſo grievouſly that he leaveth him for dead, and afterward flyeth, and the man wounded reviveth: And yet notwithſtanding, it was then adjudged to be felony, inſomuch as the will appeareth to have killed him; the will ſhall bee taken for the deed. And with the ſame agreeth <hi>Bracton,</hi>who ſaith, In things ill done, the will, not the end is looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not materiall whether any man kills, or be the cauſe of death. But this Law is not now in force, for he muſt be dead indeed before it be adiudged Felony. And if a man hurt another with an intent to beate him, but not to kill him, yet notwithſtanding if he die of ſuch beating, it is felony in him that ſo did beate him, wherefore at this day a man may convert the text to <hi>Bractons</hi> opinion, and ſay, The end in things ill done, not the will alone is looked upon, as in the caſe next before, &amp;c. <hi>vide titulo memorato,</hi> where for the malitious words of a woman 2. men fought, and the one killed the other, the woman in this caſe was arraigned of the death of him that was ſlain: The like caſe if three men goe together to make a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame, and one of the ſe three doth kill a man, the other two in this caſe are taken to be principall Felons, and yet they did it not of any evill will, but onely came in one company together, <hi>quod vide titulo Fitz.</hi> 305.

               <p>It is a common erudition amongſt us, That if a Statute Law give a remedy for any offence, we may underſtand thereby, that before there was no remedy for the ſame offence at the Common Law, other then is not expreſſ ed in the ſaid Stat. except we have read any thing that may induce us to beleeve the contrary. The Statute of Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter the fir ſt, <hi>cap.</hi>13. defendeth Rape in this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> The keepers of the Liberty of England by authority of Parliament defendeth that none ſhall raviſ h nor take by force a maide within the age of eleven yeares with her conſent, or without her conſent, nor any dame or maide of age, nor other woman againſt their wils, and if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſ o doe, the Keepers of the Liberty of Engl. aforeſaid ſhall doe him common right, and if none commence the ſuit within 40. dayes, then the Keepers of the Liberty of England may ſ ue, and thoſe that ſhall be found culpable ſhall have two yeares impriſ onment, and afterwards ſhall be arraigned at the Keepers of the Liberty of England a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſ aid pleaſure, &amp; if he be not araigned, he ſhal be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ hed by more longer impriſonment, according to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the treſpaſſe. The Readers of this Stat. if they have not read <hi>Glanvill</hi> &amp; <hi>Bracton</hi> do think that by the common Law Law Rape was but treſpaſs, where in truth it was ſelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or other more grievous crime, &amp; firſt <hi>Bracton</hi> in his 2.<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60734:17"/>book of Rape ſaith in this manner, <hi>Rape of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgins is a certaine crime which a woman layes upon any, by whom ſhe ſhe ſayes ſhe was violently oppreſſed againſt the peace, and which offence if it bee convicted, puniſhment followes, to wit, loſſe of Members, that there may be member for mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, when the Virgin is deflowred ſhe looſes a member, hee that deflowred her ſhall be puni ſhed in the part offending.</hi> Here I have expounded that which was the common Law in Rape before the Statute of Weſ tm. 1. wherewith <hi>Glanvill</hi> agreeth, <hi>fol.</hi> 113. Al ſo I finde amongſt the Lawes of <hi>St. Edwin,</hi> once King of this weale publique, this Law, <hi>If any man has to doe with a Nune, let him bee puniſhed as a Homicide.</hi>By the which it appeareth, that he which hath committed but fornication with a Nun, or with a holy woman, he ſhould be puniſhed as a Homicide, <hi>A multo forciori,</hi> then ſ hould he be puniſhed if hee had raviſ hed. So that Rape at the beginning was much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted, and abhorred, and very great and greivous puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment adjoyned thereunto, till the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> 1. who ſ eemeth by his law made at Weſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And in like manner, where a man ſhall raviſh a woman, dame eſpouſed, damoſell, or any other woman by force, although ſhe aſſent to the ſame afterwards, hee ſhall have the like judgement as before is ſaid, ſo that he be attainted at the Keepers of the Liberty of England by Authority of Parliament ſuit, and in that caſe the keepers of the Liberty of England afore ſaid ſhall have their ſuite.</p>
               <p>The Statute maketh no definition of rape, but leaveth the ſame to the common Law. Al ſo it ſeemeth to make a difference between raviſhment with force, and raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60734:17"/>without force, And therefore <hi>quaere</hi> what manner of fact he intendeth, <hi>Britton</hi>ſaith, <hi>fol.</hi> 45. that if a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man at the time of the Rape conceiveth with childe by the Raviſher, that it is no Rape, for that, that no woman can conceive if ſhe aſſent not thereunto. Alſo <hi>Bracton</hi> ſaith, That it is a good plea in an Appeale of Rape, to ſay, that before the time of the Raviſ hment ſuppoſed to be done, he held and uſed the Plaintife as his Concubine; Alſo it is a good Plea for him to ſay, that though he did lye with her, yet he knew her not carnally, for that is the force of a declaration in an Appeale of Rape. And alſo note, that if a man bee to bee charged with Rape by way of Indictment, or otherwiſe, he ought to bee charged expreſly by this word <hi>Rapuit,</hi> and not by any other words, though they amount to as much as this word <hi>Rapuit</hi> doth, <hi>ut puta carnaliter cognovit &amp; hujuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modi,</hi> as it appeareth 19.<hi>E.</hi> 4. <hi>fol.</hi> 27.

A Sherife although he make requeſt to open the doores, and deniall is made, if he ſhould then breake them, and ſo enter and doe execution: that men in the night as well as in the day, ſhould have their houſes broken upon any fained matter, for although that a Sherife be an Officer of great authority and truſt, yet it appeareth by daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that all or the moſt part of the Keepers of the liberties of England by authority of Parliament Writs, are executed, and ſerved, by underſ herifes and Bailifes, which moſt commonly are perſons of ſmall value and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. And all the authorities which doe prove that when the Proceſſe concerne the aforeſaid Keepers of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of England, that the Sherife may then breake the houſe of any man to execute them, if otherwiſe hee cannot execute them, implyeth that at the ſuit of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon perſon, the houſe cannot be broken juſtifiably, and with this reſolution agreeth the booke in 6. <hi>Edw.</hi> 4 <hi>fol.</hi> 9. A <hi>fieri facias</hi> is onely againſt the goods and chattels of a man, as moveable goods, or Leaſes for yeares, and the ſherife had need to be very carefull how, and after what manner he doth execute this Writ, leſt he burne his fingers, for if the goods or Leaſes which he taketh in execution be not the defendants owne goods, or Leaſes, although he may finde them in the poſſeſſion of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, which is the beſt colour in Law to prove them, his, if he uſe them and take the profit and benefit of them as appeareth in <hi>Twynes</hi> caſe in ſir <hi>Ed.

               <p>Alſo ſ ometimes it doth fall out, that the goods and chattels which a Sherife upon ſuch a Writ taketh in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, are not the defendants, and then the Sherife is a treſpaſſer to the Owner of the goods, as if the Lands be pawned to the defendant, they are none of his untill the day of the redeeming of them be paſt, 34.

               <p>If goods taken in execution upon tryall are found to be none of the defendants, then the Sherife ſhall pay da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages to the owner of the goods, to the value of the goods ſo taken, and coſts of ſuit, although he hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them to the plaintife in execution, if he have returned his Writs, that he hath taken ſo much goods of the defendants, and that he hath thoſe monies ready to tender &amp;c to the plaintife, then he is at a double miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe; for although the value of the goods be recovered againſt him by the owner of the goods, yet the plaintife in the action may within the yeare after execution done, have a <hi>Scire facias</hi> upon the judgment and returne, and thereby compell the Sherife to bring the money into the Court, and after the yeare he may have an action of debt againſt the ſherife for it, if he be not otherwiſe ordered by the Court where the Judgment is depending. And therefore in this caſ e the ſureſt courſe for the Sherife, is either to keepe the goods untill the parties bee agreed, or elſe to take good ſecurity of the plaintife to defend him and ſave him harmele ſſe, and to ſtay the returning of his Writs, untill he may be well adviſed what to doe therein, for if he take a bond of the plaintife, it is queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable whether it be good or no in Law, and not with in the compaſſe of the ſtatute of 23.

               <p>FIrſt, in Hillarie Terme next after they are out of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, the high Sherife and underſ herifes of moſt Shires are ſworne to yeeld and give a juſt and true account to the Keepers of the liberties of England by authoritie of Parliament and their officers in the publique Excheq. which they ſhall be charged withall, by the greene wax of the Exchequer, and of all wayſes, ſtreyes, and felons goods, which happened within the compaſ ſe of their office, and of all other profits whatſoever, due and belonging to the weale publique, and chargeable by them to anſwer for, by reaſon of their office, or much to this effect. Now when this is done, the high Sherife commonly takes no further care, beeauſe he thinkes himſelfe ſecure, by reaſon of his ſecuritie which he hath of his underſherife, for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he relyes, and ſeldome or never remembers what oath he hath taken, and ſo commits all to his underſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rife; then if his underſherife be a carefull and an honeſ t man and have skill and regard to doe his beſt endeavour to levie the Keepers of the liberties of England by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of Parliament debts, and to pay them into the receit duely and orderly, as they ought to be, then the high Sherife may doe well enough, and therein diſ charge both his oath and and his Oath and dutie, but if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, a lewd, or an ignorant underſherife, may both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe his high Sherife, and himſelfe, both in this world, and in the world to come, by <hi>totting</hi> and <hi>nichling,</hi> that is, in charging or diſ charging, unorderly, unhoneſtly, or or ignorantly, for if if be totted, that is charged, though it can never be levied: it will now hardly be avoided, but it mu ſt be paid, and if it be nichiled, if it be iſſues of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60734:56"/>though they be never ſo bad, and cannot be levyed, betweene the old Sherife which returned them, and the new ſherife which nichiſed them, they muſt bee payed, though it be ſeven yearer after, if there come no pardon in the meane time, by an old Statute made in the 27 yeare of <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. and to prevent this, it behoves all Sherifes before they take upon them to returne any Jurors, to get them a perfect booke of all the ſufficient Freeholders names in the ſhire, and eſpecially of all which dwell in the gilda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, howſoever they doe of thoſe which dwell in liberties, but of both is beſt, that the one may help the other, and to returne ſew or none that be meane Freeholders in the gildable, leſt by the ſayd Law they bee enforced to pay their iſſues for them, which is a thing very hardly to be brought to paſſe, unleſſe the Juſtices of P. in every quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the countrie, do cauſe the Conſtables and Ballifs to bring a true certificate thereof to the firſt quarter ſeſſions that ſhall be holden in the ſhire, after the election of the new ſherife, to be delivered unto him there, and this will hardly bee done, unleſſe the Judges of Aſſiſe of every ſhire will be pleaſed to write their letters to that end and purpoſe to the Juſ tices of peace of every diviſion.</p>

God delivered to his ſervant <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> ten Laws or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, which are divided into two tables, the four firſt which are the firſt table, do teach us our duties to God, the other ſix which are the ſecond table, do teach us our duties one towards another: as the body of man is ſubject to many ſickneſſes and diſeaſes, ſo the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth is ſubject to many miſchiefs and inconveniences, and as the one is often curable by phyſick, ſo the other is<pb n="166" facs="tcp:60734:87"/>to be redreſſed and reformed by the due execution of Laws which are as the ſinews of the Commonwealth, to keep it in good order, and the execution of the Law is the life of the Law, otherwiſe it is but as a dead thing, and therefore good Rulers and Magiſ trates are ſaid to be as foſtering fathers and mothers to the Commonwealth, as well as natural parents are to their own children, and the people that honor their Governors, the child that honoreth his parents, and the ſervant that honoreth his or her maſter or miſtris, ought to honor them of duty in ſingleneſs of heart, and not for fear of puni ſhment, or hope of reward.</p>
                              <p> 
                                 <hi>England</hi> long ſince was divided into Counties, and ſo into Hundreds, Ridings, Lathes, Leets, and Wapen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, which are all one in effect, though they differ in name according to the cuſ tome of every Country. And there is no man living within this Nation, but he is reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and abiding within the precinct of ſ ome one of theſe and there he ought to appear twice every yeer, if he be not otherwiſe priviledged by his place or office, and if any wrong be done unto any man under the value of forty ſhillings, there he ought to have redreſs, and not elſwhere. Then theſe Laws were afterwards confirmed by the Statute of <hi>Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And before the Statute of <hi>Quia emptores terrarum,</hi> A man ſeiſed of Land, infeoffed another of ten Acres, another of twelve Acres, a third of twenty Acres, to be holden of himſ elf, and the Tenants to do him ſervice, and pay him a quit rent, and ſo by this means by continuance of time out of the memory of man, ſuch donor or feoffor had a Mannor.</p>
                  <p>Alſo, 33. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>tit. Compriſ e.</hi> A man at this day can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make a Mannor; For although that a gift in taile be made to divers to hold of the donor by his ſervices or ſuit of Court, although this be a tenure, yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make a Court, for it cannot be without preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Alſo if a man have a Mannor, and all his free ſuiters but one do commit felony, or die without heirs general or ſpecial, whereby their land eſcheats, or if the Lord purchaſe their lands, the Mannor is deſtroyed; for it cannot be a Mannor without Suiters, there muſt be two at the leaſt, as it appeereth by 35. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>tit.

And for that you ſhall the better conſider and inquire of, and preſent all things which are now here preſentable, I have mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred unto you a corporal oath, which oath ſtandeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on three parts (that is to ſay) upon Truth, Judgement, and Juſtice: It ſ tandeth upon truth, for that you ought to preſent nothing but the Truth, and likewiſe not to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any thing that is true and preſentable here unpre ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; It ſ tandeth upon Judgement, that you do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent any thing raſhly or unadviſedly, but certainly to know the truth thereof before you do preſent it; And it ſ tandeth upon Juſtice, that you do not for favor, affection, corruption of money, or other reward, for fear of any mans diſ pleaſure, or for any private gaine or profit, leave any thing unpreſented that is here preſ entable, neither for malice to preſent any thing contrary to the truth. Theſe three principal things you ought duely to conſ ider of, and ſo hoping that you will have a ſpecial care there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, according to your oaths and duties, and the truſt that is repoſed in you, I will cea ſe to trouble you any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at this time by way of exhortation, and proceed to your Charge.</p>

                           <p>And I muſt tell you, If there be two Coparcenes, or two Joyntenants which do owe ſuit and ſervice to this Court for any Lands which they hold of the Lord of this Mannor, the one of them ought to be here to do the ſame, ſuit, and the other ought to be contributer to his charge.</p>
                           <p>Alſo if any Tenant having twenty acres of Land granteth or letteth the ſame to twenty ſeveral perſons, in this caſe every one of thoſe twenty ought to do ſuch ſuit and ſ ervice as hath been accuſtomed to be done for the ſame Land.</p>

                           </p>
                           <p>Alſo if any copiholder have ſurrendred his copihold te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement into the hands of two of the tenants ſince the la ſt court to the uſe of any perſon, every ſuch ſurrender ought to be pre ſented at this Court, or elſe the tenants which took ſuch ſurrender, ought to forfeit their copiholds, becauſe it may be thought if they do not pre ſent it, that they go about not only to defeat the Lord of his fine, but alſo to diſinherit the party to who ſe uſe the ſame ſ ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render was taken.</p>
                           <p>Alſo if any Copiholder having two Copiholds, hath impaired the one to amend the other, this is a forfeiture of the Copihold that is impaired.</p>
                           <p>Alſo if any Villain or Bondman of blood, hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed any Land within his Lordſhip, the Lord may ſei ſe both it and ſuch villains goods at his pleaſure.</p>
                           <p>Alſo you ſhall inquire whether any Tenant of this mannor hath given any of his lands in mortmain, That is to ſ ay, to any religious houſe, religious perſon, and their ſucceſſ ors, or to any Guild, Fraternity, or corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and their ſucceſſors, without the Keepers of the Liberty of <hi>England,</hi> by Authority of Parliaments licence, and the Lords of this Mannor, for it is here inquirable and preſentable, to the end that the Lord if there be any ſuch grant made, may make his claim within the yeer and the day, according to the ſ tatute in that caſe made and provided.</p>
                           <p>Alſo if any Tenant hath ſold his land by Deed, and
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:60734:111"/>hath not given notice thereof to the Lord, nor he which bought it hath not done his fealty to the Lord, or ſuit of Court, ſo that by reaſon thereof the Lord doth not know who is his tenant, therefore you ought to preſent it: for it is very needful and neceſſary, that the lord ſhould know who is his Tenant, by reaſon of his ſervices and eſcheats which may grow due unto him.</p>
                           <p>Alſo if any Tenant within this Lordſhip hath ſuffered any houſe of husbandry to decay by taking of the land from it to lay it to another, in this caſe the Lord ought to have the moity of the profits thereof to his own uſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it be made and maintained a Husbandry again, and this you ought to inquire of for the Lords benefit.</p>
                           <p>Alſo if any Tenant hath incloſed any land which hath been accuſtomed to lie open without the Lords licence and the Freeholders, you muſt preſent it, for he cannot juſtifie the doing thereof.</p>
                           <p>Alſo you ſhall inquire whether any of the Lords lands within this Mannor be withholden from him, and held and occupied without his licence, if there be any ſuch thing, then you muſt inquire by whom it is withholden, and what land it is, and what it is worth by the yeer, and how long it hath been withholden that the Lord may recover his damage for the withholding thereof ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
                           <p>Alſo you ſ hall inquire whether there be any rent cuſtome, or ſervice, behind and unpayed to the Lord of this Mannor, by whom it is due, and what rent, cuſtome, or ſervice it is, how long it hath been withholden, and where the land lieth, that the Lord may diſ traine for the arrearages thereof.</p>
                           <p>Alſo you ſhall inquire if any Bailiff or other officer of this Mannor, hath made any arreſt for any rent, cu ſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ome, or ſervice, due to the Lord of this Mannor, and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couſe therein hath been made; you ought then to preſent him or them which made the reſcouſe, and where and when it was done.</p>
                           <p>Alſo if any diſtreſs hath been taken and put into the<pb n="216" facs="tcp:60734:112"/>lords pound, and hath been taken out from thence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leave or authority of the law, then ſuch taking is a pound breach, and here inquirable and preſ entable.</p>
                           <p>Alſo if any tenant doth ſurcharge the common by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting more cattel there then by the cuſtome he ought to have go there, or by putting of cattel there not common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as pigs, goats, and geeſe, and ſ uch like, you muſt preſent them.</p>

                           <p>Al ſo if any man hath removed any bounds or marks, meer-ſ tones or ſtakes, between this Lordſhip and any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or between tenant and tenant, you muſt preſent their names; for it is an evil oſſice, and they deſerve to be puniſ hed for it.</p>
                           <p>Alſo if any man hath fiſhed, hawked, or hunted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Lord ſhip, without the leave or licenſe of the Lord of this Mannor, you muſt preſent them, for they are the Lords Realties, and therefore no man can law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully come here to do either one or the other without his leave.</p>
                           <p>Alſo if any tenant by reaſon of his tenure ought to grinde at the Lords Mill, if he do it not, you muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent him.</p>

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:60734:112"/>to be done, and as yet is not done, you muſt enquire who have made default therein, and preſent his heirs, or their names: And you ſhal likewiſe inquire of all other things which you ſhall think needful to be inquired of, by me omitted, and not given you in charge, a ſwel as if I had given you it in charge, and ſo bring in your preſentment in writing by one of the clock in the afternoone.</p>

                  <p>And you muſt underſtand, that whoſover will caſt any eſſoin in theſe Courts, he muſt come at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Court when proclamation is made, or elſe he ought not to be received.</p>

                  <p>And you muſt alſo underſtand, that for every default that the defendant maketh after this appearance, and day given to anſ wer or do his Law, and then make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault at any day, he ſhall be called <hi> non-ſ uit,</hi> and he and his pledges amercied, and that is where the plaintif is a ſtranger dwelling out of the juriſdiction of the Court, where he finds pledges, if the caſe ſhould paſs againſt him, his pledges muſ t then pay the defendants coſt, which is a thing ever reaſ onable, but ſ eldome or never uſed.</p>
                  <p>And the Steward of the Court, at the beginning of the Court muſt inquire of the Bailife how he hath ſerved the attachments and diſtreſſes, and other precepts to him directed, and if he ſay that they were ſerved, then call the parties, and if the plaintife have not his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration ready when the defendant appeareth, he muſt be called <hi>non-ſuit,</hi> thus. <hi>A.B.</hi> come forth and proſecute thy Action againſt <hi>C.D.</hi> or elſe thou wilt be <hi>non-ſuit:</hi> and if he come not forth ſitting the Court, or ſome for him to crave further time to declare, which the Court in diſcretion may grant him, then he ſhall be <hi>non-ſuit</hi> of courſe: and if the defendant make default, proceſſe mu ſt goe forth againſt him: and in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall Action the proceſſe are ſummons, attachment, and diſtreſſe infinite, which attachments and diſtreſſes muſt be reaſonable, and not outragious, according to the ſtatute of <hi>Marlebridge cap.</hi> 4. And if the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant<pb n="252" facs="tcp:60734:131"/>make default upon the attachment or diſtreſs, they being ſerved, and ſo returned by the bailif, then the goods ſo taken by attachment or diſtreſs be forfeit to the Lord of the Court, and the defendant ſhal al ſo be amerced, and a new <hi>Diſtringas</hi> ſhall go out againſt him. And if the defendant appear and then after make default, he ſhall be condemned by default, and a <hi>nihil dicit</hi> entred againſt him, and the Steward muſt enter both the effect of the declaration for the plaintif, and of the plea or anſwer for the defendant.</p>
                  <p>And if the parties plead to an iſſue triable by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, proceſs muſt be made to ſummon the Jury, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>venire <abbr>fac</abbr>,</hi> and if the defendant be condemned either by default or by verdict, then a <hi>Levare <abbr>fac</abbr>

                     </hi> and laid in priſon, there to remain untill the plaintif be ſatisfied: but you muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that in a county Court, hundred Court, or court Baron, there can be no plea held where the debt or dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges amount to ten ſ hillings or above.</p>
                  <p>And it is a maxim in law, that in all courts which are not courts of record, the matter if it be for debt, ought to be tryed by oath, that is, by wager of law by the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant and not otherwiſe, unleſs it be by aſ ſent of both parties.</p>
